# Blockchain-Powered API Security

A project to secure APIs using blockchain technology. This application leverages Ethereum smart contracts to validate and record API calls, ensuring enhanced data integrity and protection against unauthorized access.

## Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Validate and record API calls using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Secure Transactions**: Hash requests and store them immutably on the blockchain.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure for seamless integration with existing APIs.
- **Custom Middleware**: Verify API calls in real-time before processing.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (for Ethereum wallet)
- An Ethereum testnet or local blockchain setup (e.g., [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/blockchain-api-security.git
   cd blockchain-api-security
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=<Your Ethereum Node URL>
     CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Deployed Contract Address>
     PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Ethereum Wallet Private Key>
     ETHEREUM_ACCOUNT=<Your Ethereum Account Address>
     ```

4. Deploy the smart contract (if not already deployed):
   - Use Truffle or Hardhat to compile and deploy the contract.
   - Update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in the `.env` file with the deployed address.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Make API calls to your secured endpoints:
   - Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to test the API.

3. Blockchain Validation:
   - Every API request will be hashed, validated, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
